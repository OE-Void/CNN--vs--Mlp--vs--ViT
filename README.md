## Comparing the most promising architecture for AI image processing of the decade

This repo have a the code and assets related to comaprison of the top 3 best archiecture used widely for image related tasks (eg. image-detecttion, image -classifiaticon etc) 

we will be rabnking all 3 arctitectures on the basis of speed for training and accuracy on a given tasks with a ceritain size dataset 

dataset used :  Mnist
Train-Split size:  60k samples
Test-Split size:  10k samples
